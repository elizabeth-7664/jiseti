#  Jiseti – Project Vision

##  Problem
Many community members face local issues like poor infrastructure, unresolved complaints, or safety concerns. However, there’s no accessible system for reporting, tracking, or resolving these challenges in a transparent, accountable way.

##  Solution
Jiseti is a civic-tech platform where users can:
- Report public issues (e.g., water problems, road damage, unsafe spaces)
- Track progress on whether issues have been addressed
- Register and log in to post, comment, upvote, or support issues
- Help administrators and authorities organize and act on reports

##  Target Users
- General public (community members)
- Local authorities or support organizations
- NGOs and donors

##  Long-Term Goal
Build a solution that creates a feedback loop between the community and responsible parties to promote accountability and faster problem-solving.
